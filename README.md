# RAEKWON WILLIAMS CISC 3130 Data Structures

An assignment for my Data Structures class where we had to create a binary tree data structure and all of its 
methods in Java to gain a better understanding of the data structure and its methods.

This assignment I stored differnet Movies in each tree node along with information on the movie like release year,
title, and genre.
